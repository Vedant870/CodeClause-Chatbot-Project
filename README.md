# 🤖 ChatBot using Python & NLTK  
_A rule-based conversational bot project for CodeClause Internship | August 2025_

---

## 👋 Introduction

Hey there! This is a **rule-based chatbot** I built as part of my **AI internship at CodeClause (August 2025)**. The bot can interact with users through simple pattern-matched conversations. It’s built using **Python**, **NLTK**, and **regex**, and runs smoothly from the command line.

💡 _This chatbot is fully customizable, lightweight, and beginner-friendly._

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Rule-based intent matching
- 💬 Human-like text replies using `re` patterns
- 🔤 Text preprocessing with NLTK
- 🎯 Simple and clean command-line interface
- 🛠️ Easy to extend with more patterns/intents

📥 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CodeClause-Chatbot-Project.git
cd CodeClause-Chatbot-Project
2️⃣ Install Required Libraries

🧪 Sample Interaction
bash
Copy
Edit
🤖 Hello! I’m a simple chatbot. Type "exit" to quit.
>>> hello
🤖 Hey there!

>>> what’s your name?
🤖 I’m your friendly chatbot buddy 😄

>>> how are you?
🤖 Doing great! Thanks for asking.

>>> bye
🤖 Goodbye! Have a nice day 🌟
🧠 How it Works
Cleans and tokenizes user input

Matches input to predefined patterns using re

Chooses appropriate responses from a pool

Keeps running until user types "exit"

It’s fully rule-based, no AI/ML is used.

📌 .gitignore File (Important!)
Make sure to include a .gitignore in your repo to avoid pushing unnecessary files:

bash
Copy
